## Overview
* A framework for application specific vector processor with exemplar building blocks 

* Simulation software with exemplar building blocks and application examples
  * This simplifies the architecture development of the hardware which performs operations on the data structures of finite length (vectors)
  
* Typical applications and their data vectors
  * Signal processing: _OFDM symbols and/or code blocks_
  * Cryptography: _cipher blocks_
  * Networking: _data packets_
  
* Framework also provides unified approach for the development of the functional components: Execution Units (EU) and Data Memories (DM) as well as for their interconnect and interoperation
  * **Specific set and configuration of the functional units are identified by the target application**

* Development and simulation methodology of the hardware architecture from system specifications (algorithms) and throughput requirements
* Follow top-down development and optimization strategy
  * Area: improvement of the utilization rate of the processing blocks and storage elements (RAMs)
  * Throughput: datapath is elaborated at the architecture development stage 
  * Dynamic Power
  * Minimization non-recurring engineering (NRE) resources and risks

* Benefits of using SystemC
  * Short update-simulation-analysis cycle which allows for simulation driven development and optimization of the architecture
  * Cycle accurate simulation for the vector core to obtain realistic timing and throughput estimates at the earlier stages
  * High level of abstraction for Vector Core preferences, runtime configuration and status to stay focused on the architectural tasks
  * Large ecosystem of C/C++ libraries for data manipulation and processing allows for top-down development approach: from high level processing functions down to elementary arithmetic operations
  * Integration into the existing simulation workflows
  * Open source

![block_diagram][block_dia]  

### Components in Brief
* 2 major parts: Vector Core and Scalar or Control Core
* Vector Core functions
  * Perform vector computations in accordance to the configuration supplied from the Scalar Core
  * Generate events at the different stages of the execution of the vector operations
    * Events are delivered to the Scalar Core 
    * Allow for synchronization of the control threads inside Scalar Core with the Vector Core 
    * Update of the statuses of the vector operations
    * Allow for data dependent processing
  * Sequencing of the vector operations

* Vector Core components 
  * Data Memories (DM): temporary storage of the vectors.
    * A set of Address Generators (AG) associated with each DM allows for flexible addressing and fetching the elements of the vector.
  * Execution Units (EU): perform successive processing of the elements of the vectors.
    * These parts of the Vector Core is specific for target application
  * Streaming Devices: interfacing Vector Core with the external devices
    * ADC (source) or DAC (sink)
    * Preceding or subsequent processing blocks
    * Interface to the external storage (DMA)
    * In simulation Streaming I/O Devices address common Data and Memory Pool
  * XBAR: Network-On-Chip (NOC) for routing the vector streams between Execution Units (EU), Data Memories (DM) and/or Streaming Devices
    * DMs, EUs and Streaming Devices have a unified interface for the connection to XBAR
    
* Functions of the Scalar Infrastructure
  * Respond to the events and status data from the Vector Core components 
  * Control the execution flow in the Vector Core
  * Synchronize vector processing threads
  * Generate and deliver configuration data to the Vector Core components

* Scalar Infrastructure components
  * Scalar Core: processes the events and statuses from Vector Core, and generates configurations for the components of the Vector Core.
    * It can be implemented as a programmable general purpose CPU subsystem or an FSM depending on the complexity of the control procedures
  * Event MUX: delivers events which were generated by the Vector Core components to the Scalar Core
  * Config De-multiplexer: delivers commands and data supplied from to the Scalar Core to the Vector Core components. 
    * Broadcasting commands are supported for the execution control 
  * Status MUX: delivers the status data, which was sent by the Vector Core components in response to the request commands from the Scalar Core, to the Scalar Core 

### Major development steps
* Decompose processing algorithm down to the level of vector transactions between functional blocks and storage elements
* Develop functional blocks which have specified interface with XBAR and Scalar Infrastructure
* Assemble the functional blocks and storage elements with the Core framework
* Develop Scalar CPU SW and/or Control FSM
